# Vipy

Vipy is a simple Python library for basic numerical computations, mimicking some of the functionality of NumPy. It supports basic array operations such as addition, matrix multiplication, transposition, and dot product for both 1D and 2D arrays.

## Features

- **Array Initialization**: Initialize arrays from Python lists.
- **Element-wise Addition**: Perform element-wise addition of two arrays.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Perform matrix multiplication between two 2D arrays.
- **Transpose**: Transpose a 2D array.
- **Dot Product**: Compute the dot product for 1D arrays and matrix multiplication for 2D arrays.

## Installation

To install Vipy, you can simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heisdenverr/vipy.git
